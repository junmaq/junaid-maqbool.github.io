<h1> About </h1>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Currently, I am working as Research assistant and teacher assistant at <a href="https://itu.edu.pk" target="_blank">Information Technology University (ITU), Lahore</a>. My research interests include Signals processing, machine learning and computer vision.
  After completing Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://itu.edu.pk" target="_blank"> University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore</a>. started working in textile industry and soon realized that there arenâ€™t enough opportunities in industry 
  to gain knowledge and learn state of the arts skills in science and technology. Two research projects are in progress structural learning of causal structure of bayesian networks are in progress,   <a href="https://www.bayesserver.com/docs/introduction/bayesian-networks" target="_blank">Bayesian network</a> for root cause analysis (RCA) of faults in industrial plants. One of the challenges in using Bayesian network is the exponential growth of distribution parameters with the number of nodes in it. We are aiming to tackle this issue by efficiently learning distribution parameters of Bayesian network using recent advances in deep neural networks.
