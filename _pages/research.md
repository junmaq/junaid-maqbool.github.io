I have worked as research assistant at <a href='https://lums.edu.pk' target='_blank'>LUMS</a>  from <b>2015</b> to <b>2018</b>. During this period, I worked on RF sensing applications using channel state information (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_state_information' target='_blank'>CSI</a>) extracted from commercially available off-the-shelf WiFi radio (<a href='https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/wireless-products/ultimate-n-wifi-link-5300-brief.html' target='_blank'>Intel 5300 WiFi Card</a>).</div>

I started experimentation with two laptops(Tx-Rx pair), each equipped with Intel 5300 WiFi card, for intrusion detection. I observed that whenever someone passes through the link between two laptops, while CSI is being captured at receiver, there are significant fluctuations in CSI data. It was my first hands-on experience with RF sensing. Later I worked on multiple applications relying on CSI and was able to publish <a href='https://asif-hanif.github.io/publications/' target='_blank'>two articles</a>. </div>

After completing bachelors in Electrical Engineering from <a href='https://www.uet.edu.pk/' target='_blank'>UET Lahore</a>; in 2018. I started working as a research assistant at <a href='https://itu.edu.pk' target='_blank'>ITU</a>; 
Here is a list of research projects that I have worked on
 
* Causal structure learning and causal inference in bayesian networks
  <a href="https://github.com/junmaq/RCA-Causal-Inference" target="_blank">Repository</a>
* Normalizing flows for reconstructing images 
* Modeling conditional densities of bayesian networks with Normalizing flow
