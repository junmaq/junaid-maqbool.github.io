Currently, I am doing MS in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://itu.edu.pk" target="_blank">Information Technology University (ITU), Lahore</a>. Realizing the potential of deep learning, I have decided to pursue research thesis that involves concepts from machine learning and deep learning. My current research work is on the use of <a href="https://www.bayesserver.com/docs/introduction/bayesian-networks" target="_blank">Bayesian network</a> for root cause analysis (RCA) of faults in industrial plants. One of the challenges in using Bayesian network is the exponential growth of distribution parameters with the number of nodes in it. We are aiming to tackle this issue by efficiently learning distribution parameters of Bayesian network using recent advances in deep neural networks.

Previously, I was research assistant at <a href="https://lums.edu.pk" target="_blank">LUMS</a> from **Oct 2015** to **2018**. My research revolved around RF sensing applications using commodity-off-the-shelf WiFi radio (<a href='https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/wireless-products/ultimate-n-wifi-link-5300-brief.html' target='_blank'>Intel 5300 WiFi Card</a>).
